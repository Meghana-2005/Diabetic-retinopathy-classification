# Diabetic-retinopathy-classification
Combined ResNet50 and InceptionV3 CNN model for image classification

This project presents an automated deep learning-based system for detecting and classifying **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)** using retinal fundus images. The system leverages a **hybrid CNN model** combining **ResNet50** and **InceptionV3** architectures, trained on the APTOS 2019 dataset. The model is deployed via a web application using Flask, enabling easy use by healthcare providers or patients.

## 📘 Introduction

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a severe complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness if left untreated. It damages the retina due to prolonged high blood sugar levels, causing vascular changes. Traditional diagnosis methods involve manual inspection by trained ophthalmologists, which is time-consuming, subjective, and inaccessible in many regions. 

This project offers an automated, scalable, and accurate solution to DR detection using a hybrid CNN model. The model classifies DR into five stages:
- 0: No DR
- 1: Mild
- 2: Moderate
- 3: Severe
- 4: Proliferative DR

## 📊 Dataset

- **Name**: APTOS2019 - 10K Augmented Images
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aitude/aptos-augmented-images)
- **Size**: 10,000 high-resolution fundus images
- **Class distribution**: 2000 images per DR severity class

Preprocessing includes resizing, scaling, brightness adjustment, and zooming to ensure uniform quality and reduce overfitting.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

A **hybrid model** is developed using:
- **ResNet50** for deep residual learning, effective at capturing complex patterns.
- **InceptionV3** for multi-scale feature extraction.

### Key Steps:
1. Load both pre-trained models without top layers.
2. Extract features from input images.
3. Apply Global Average Pooling to reduce dimensionality.
4. Concatenate the features from both models.
5. Add dense layers, batch normalization, and dropout for generalization.
6. Final classification via softmax (multi-class output).
7. Fine-tune selected layers of both models for dataset-specific learning.
